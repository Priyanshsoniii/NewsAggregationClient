# News Aggregation Server

## Overview

The News Aggregation Server is a .NET-based backend application that periodically collects news from multiple external APIs, processes and categorizes the news, manages user authentication, and serves structured news data to a client application via RESTful APIs. It supports user and admin roles, notification management, article reporting, and personalized news recommendations.

---

## Features

- **Periodic News Aggregation:** Fetches news headlines from external APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, The News API) every 3-4 hours and stores them in a relational database.
- **RESTful API:** Exposes endpoints for user authentication, news retrieval, article management, notifications, and admin operations.
- **User Management:** Handles registration, login, and role-based access (Admin/User).
- **News Categorization:** Automatically assigns categories to news articles, even if missing from the source, using content analysis.
- **Notifications:** Sends news notifications and articles to users via email, based on their preferences and keywords.
- **Personalization:** Recommends news based on user interests, saved articles, likes, and notification settings.
- **Admin Controls:** Allows admins to manage external news sources, categories, filter/hide articles or categories, and handle reported content.
- **Reporting & Moderation:** Users can report articles; admins are notified and can hide content. Articles with excessive reports are auto-hidden.
- **Layered Architecture:** Follows clean code, SOLID principles, and a layered structure (Controllers, Services, Repositories, Models).
- **API Documentation:** All endpoints are documented (e.g., via Swagger).
- **Testing:** Includes unit and system test cases for core logic.

---

## Architecture

- **Controllers:** Handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Services:** Business logic for news aggregation, user management, notifications, etc.
- **Repositories:** Data access layer for interacting with the database.
- **Models/DTOs:** Define data structures for entities and API communication.
- **Background Services:** Periodically fetch and process news from external APIs.
- **Utilities:** Helper classes for tasks like email sending, category inference, etc.

---

## Database

- **Type:** Relational (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL)
- **Why Relational?**  
  - Supports complex queries, relationships (users, articles, categories, notifications).
  - Ensures data integrity and transactional consistency.
  - Scalable for user/content management and reporting features.

## External APIs

- **NewsAPI:** https://newsapi.org/
- **The News API:** https://www.thenewsapi.com/documentation
- **(Optional) Firebase API for test data**
